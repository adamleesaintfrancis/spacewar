The edu.ou.mlfw.config package contains the classes necessary for configuring
how a World instance finds and initializes its component simulator and clients.

At the top level is a WorldConfig.  A WorldConfig contains an entry indicating
the class that implements the Simulator interface that should be loaded, and an 
entry for a configuration file that can be used by that Simulator instance.  
A WorldConfig also contains mappings between controllables and 
ClientInitializers via a ClientMapping array.  The WorldConfiguration file 
should be provided by the user.

A ClientInitializer points to an implementation of the Client interface 
and a file that can be passed to this implementation for configuration.
The ClientInitializer file is provided by the client writer.
