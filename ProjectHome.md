Spacewar was developed by a group of students in a machine learning course at the University of Oklahoma.  It was later used as a teaching tool in an artificial intelligence course.

Although it is based on the original Spacewar!, this version supports multiple ships and moving obstacles.  The basic gameplay elements remain.  Multiple players pilot ships through space by using the arrow keys while attempting to shoot at each other.

Spacewar is a great environment for testing machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms.  It pushes algorithms to their limits by requiring continuous decision making, and it is a lot of fun to watch.
