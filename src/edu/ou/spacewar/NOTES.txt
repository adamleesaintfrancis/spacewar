# The merge continues, with a priority on bringing in the class code since that is the code
  that's written up in the SIGCSE paper.  
+ Refactor items into a more sensible package structure, with edu.ou as root.  This structure
  should reflect the basic functionality of the individual components.  I see this as breaking
  down into the following:
  - Basic generic utilities that could see broad reuse in a variety of places (not Spacewar specific)
  - The basic physics of the Spacewar simulator
  - The different types of objects that populate the Spacewar world
  - The immutable counterparts to the object types (that are sent to the ai clients)
  - The spacewar GUI backend
  - The GUI components counterpart for each object type
  - The ai infrastructure
