To make sure that you can properly compile and run Spacewar, open a command 
line, make sure that your current working directory is the Spacewar project 
root (where this file is located), and run the "hello" ant task:

> ant hello

(Note that the ">" character just indicates the command prompt; you shouldn't 
type it.)

If this doesn't work, your system isn't configured properly; you have some 
setup work to do.  If this does work, great!  Either way, head on over to the 
"docs" directory for more detailed information, including a setup guide, a
concepts guide, and the generated javadocs for the project.
