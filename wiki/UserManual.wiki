#summary A short user manual for both students and educators.

= Introduction =

This manual is under construction.  It will be ready for the SIGCSE open source release on March 8, 2007.

= Details =

Spacewar is actually two projects:

1.)  A simple framework for writing simulators and clients for artificial intelligence algorithms, along with utilities for adding graphics, reporting on client performance, and running tournaments among many clients. 

2.)  An implemented simulator, Spacewar, that allows students to take control of a small spaceship navigating around moving asteroids and other hostile ships.  This spaceship can be controlled by both humans but, more importantly for classwork, it can be controlled by writing intelligent controllers.

Each component uses simple XML-based configuration to control its behavior.

= The Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence Framework = 

The main class in the framework is the World class.  A World instance is responsible for driving a simulator, and for joining controllable objects exposed by the simulator with clients that control them.
