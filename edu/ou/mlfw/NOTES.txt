Machine Learning Framework

Goals:
1.)  Code separation of agents and simulators to allow for independent development of each
2.)  Runtime separation of agents and simulators to allow for multi-agent competition
3.)  Simplified agent development focused on AI/ML issues (rather than simulaton details)
4.)  Benchmarking for agent performance using simulator and agent-specific metrics
5.)  GUI mode for human interaction and visual feedback during development
6.)  Non-GUI mode for higher-throughput simulation

Controllables define what actions are available to manipulate objects in a Simulator.
The simulator understands how specified actions are to be interpreted for a controllable
in context of other controllables, non-controllables, and some set of internal simulation 
"physics".  

A controllable can be seen as presenting two interfaces:  for an agent, the controllable 
presents a set of actions tht can be taken at any given time, and accepts a 

Agents decide which actions a controllable should take at any given time, based on the information
about the state of the Simulator available through an Environment.  An Environment provides an 
abstraction layer that can be used to hide, limit access to, or otherwise transform simulator details, 
and different environments can be defined so that different agents or controllables can interact with 
the same simulator.

A World acts as a bridge between a single Simulator and the Environments and Agents associated with
each Controllable.  Every Controllable must have exactly one Agent, and every Agent has exactly one
Environment.
